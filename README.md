# HTML Sketch

This is some boiler plate HTML, Javascript and CSS that I use to quickly sketch up a page or idea.

## How to use it

[Download](https://github.com/jweir/Bluemold/zipball/master) the zip file, uncompress it and edit away.

The files to edit are *sketch.html*, *sketch.js* and *sketch.css*.
